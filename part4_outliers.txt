#============= Bayescan: looking for Fst outliers

# Converting vcf (using PGDspider) to Bayescan format: 

# make tab-delimited file called bspops LISTING assignments of individuals (as they are named in the vcf file) to populations, for example:
ind1	pop0
ind2	pop0
ind3	pop1
ind4	pop1

# create a file called vcf2bayescan.spid containing this text:
echo "############
