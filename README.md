Scripts for analyzing my 2bRAD data from corals in French Polynesia (modified from Dr. Mikhail Matz's scripts at https://github.com/z0on/2bRAD_denovo)


Part 1: Genome</br>
Placing & indexing reference genome - if you don't have a reference genome you'll have to see Misha's instructions at https://github.com/z0on/2bRAD_denovo

Part 2: Reads</br>
Filtering & trimming raw reads</br>
Mapping reads to reference genome to create .bam files

Part 3: Population structure</br>
Using .bam files to explore population structure in PCA & K plot

Part 4: FST outliers</br>
Using .vcf file to find FST outliers using Bayescan
